Searching for new job is a lot of work. It involves finding job openings, applying for jobs, preparing for interviews, and negotiating an offer. There are a lot of great tools for searching for positions and there is a lot of great online career advice, but the sites are not focused on helping people with all of the hard work of organizing their job searches. CareerQB is a new job search site with the goal of providing the tools people need to land their dream job.

Search for millions of Healthcare, Legal, Finance, Marketing, Human Resources, Engineering, and Technology jobs posted on [Indeed.com](http://indeed.com) and [CareerBuilder.com](http://careerbuilder.com) from a single site, CareerQB. CareerQB aggregates multiple job search sites into a single site and we will be adding new job search sites over the coming months.

Never lose a job posting by saving postings from multiple job search sites in a single location. I cannot count how many times that I saw a job posting that looked interesting and I forgot to bookmark it. When I went to search for it a few days later - I was unable to find it because I could not remember which job site that I found the position.
