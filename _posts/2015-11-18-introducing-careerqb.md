Searching for a new job is a lot of work and can be very stressful. It involves finding job openings, applying for jobs, preparing for interviews, and negotiating an offer. There are a lot of great job search websites and there are a lot of websites that offer great career advice, but none of the sites are focused on helping you with the hard work of organizing your job search. CareerQB is a new job search site with the goal of providing the tools to help you organize your job search so you can land your dream job.

CareerQB allows you to find job openings by aggregating the results from multiple job search sites. You can search millions of Healthcare, Legal, Finance, Marketing, Human Resources, Engineering, and Technology jobs posted on [Indeed.com](http://indeed.com) and [CareerBuilder.com](http://careerbuilder.com) from a single site, [CareerQB](https://careerqb.com). We currently only support Indeed and CareerBuilder, but we will be adding more job search sites over the coming months.

Never lose a job posting by saving postings from multiple job search sites in a single location. I cannot count how many times that I saw a job posting that looked interesting and I forgot to bookmark it. When I went to search for it a few days later - I was unable to find it because I could not remember where I found the position. Now you can save all of your jobs on CareerQB.

CareerQB makes it easy to organize and prioritize your job search with a simple and innovative workflow based on the Toyota lean manufacturing kanban process. Instead of organizing tasks by due dates, organize tasks into the following discrete buckets of work. 

* __In Progress:__ Add the top 5 tasks you want to complete to the In Progress folder. After completing a task move it to the Completed folder.

* __On Hold:__ If a task becomes blocked then move it to On Hold, so you know that you do not have to work on it.

* __Unassigned:__ All tasks that you have not prioritized are added automatically to the Unassigned folder. When the In Progress folder is empty, move items from Unassigned to the In Progress folder.

* __Completed:__ The Completed folder contains all the items that you have finished. After completing an item move it to the Completed folder

We are just beginning to build out the CareerQB job search tools and will be adding new features over the next few months. We would love to get your feedback and to get your suggestions for new features and enhancements.
